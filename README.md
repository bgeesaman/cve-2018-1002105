The original PoC code was modified to go a bit beyond checking for vulnerability and to actually run a command inside the first container in the first namespace.  In this case, `curl -s google.com` inside the first pod/container in the default namespace on most clusters.  From here, it's easy to make an actual tool to extract secrets, code, exfil data, etc.
